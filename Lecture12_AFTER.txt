1. How do private-key or symmetric cryptography and public-key or asymmetric cryptography 
	differ?

	1. Symmetric encryption uses a single key that needs to be shared among the people 
	who need to receive the message while asymmetrical encryption uses a pair of 
	public key and a private key to encrypt and decrypt messages when communicating.
	2. Symmetric encryption is an old technique while asymmetric encryption is 
	relatively new.
	3. Asymmetric encryption was introduced to complement the inherent problem of the 
	need to share the key in symmetrical encryption model, eliminating the need to 
	share the key by using a pair of public-private keys.
	4. Asymmetric encryption takes relatively more time than the symmetric encryption.

2. What is the difference between encrypting a string and hashing it?

	Hashing is used to validate the integrity of the content by detecting all 
	modifications and thereafter changes to a hash output. Encryption encodes data for 
	the primary purpose of maintaining data confidentiality and security. It requires 
	a private key to reversible function encrypted text to plain text.
	In short, encryption is a two-way function that includes encryption and decryption 
	whilst hashing is a one-way function that changes a plain text to a unique digest 
	that is irreversible.
	Hashing and encryption are different but also have some similarities. They are 	
	both ideal in handling data, messages and information in computing systems. They 
	both transform or change data into a different format. While encryption is 
	reversible, hashing is not. Future improvements are very crucial given that 	
	attackers keep changing tactics. This implies that an up-to-date way of hashing 
	and encrypting is more palatable in modern computing systems.
