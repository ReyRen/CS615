1. What do we need backups?
	a. long-term storage/archival
	b. recover from data loss due to
		1). equipment failure
		2). bozotic users
		3). natural disaster
		4). security breach
		5). software bugs
2. What is the ZFS snapshots?
	a. ZFS uses a copy-on-write transactional object model(new data does not 
	overwrite existing data, instead modifications are written to a new location
	with existing data being referenced), similar to WAFL
	b. a snapshot is a read-only copy of a file system(cheap and near instantaneous,
	due to CoW)
	c. initially consumes to additional disk space; the writable filesystem is made
	available as "clone"
	d. conceptually provides a branched view of the filesystem; normally only the 
	"active" filesystem is writable.
