1. What is the Distributed Systems?
	
	CM systems are distributed systems. As such, they are subject to the CAP Theorem:
	Consistency: all systems managed by the CM are consistent within their respective 
	service definition.
	Availability: the services managed by the CM are kept available, even if no 
	further updates or change sets can be retrieved.
	Partition tolerance: the CM system can (continue to) operate despite interruptions 
	between its components; e.g. intermediate (coordinated) changes are not required.

2. What is the Puppet?

	Puppet gives you an automatic way to inspect, deliver, operate and future-proof 
	all of your software, no matter where it runs. With the Puppet approach, you know 
	what you have so you can control and enforce consistency across it, secure it and 
	keep it compliant, all the while modernizing it as business needs dictate. You 
	define what you want your apps and infrastructure to look like using a common 
	easy-to-read language. From there you can share, test and enforce the changes you 
	want to make across your data center and cloud platforms. And at every step of the 
	way, you have the visibility and reporting you need to make decisions and prove 
	compliance.
